WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net CLK_14M_rstpot is sourced
   by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

      Number with same-slice carry load:         4
      Number with other load:                    0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,786 out of   3,758   47%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       440 out of   7,516    5%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        6,240
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         1,256 out of   6,240   20%

    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:           1,590 out of  30,064    5%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
